### Docker CONCEPTS ###

### Application
Application developed separately and indepentently from Docker.

### Image
Blueprint of our application which form the basis of containers. All custom images are based off of a base image.

### Container
Created from a Docker image and run the actual application. We can create a container using the "docker run"
command. A list of running containers can be seen using the "docker ps" command.

### Service
?

### Stack
TO BE VERIFIED
Group of services running in different containers, giving the application every external reference needed.

### Swarm
TO BE VERIFIED
Group of VMs composed of a Manager and a series of workers. This group can run simple, single containers 
or stack services.

### Docker Daemon
The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. 
The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system to which clients talk to.

### Docker Client
The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other 
forms of clients too - such as Kitematic which provide a GUI to the users.

### Docker Hub
A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. 
If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.
